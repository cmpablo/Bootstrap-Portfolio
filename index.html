                            Homer no function beer well without. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Old people don't need companionship. They
                            need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be
                            extracted for our personal use.

                            Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! I'm going to the back seat of
                            my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! Your guilty consciences may
                            make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes,
                            brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without
                            a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering
                            my disgust throughout the world. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and
                            lived to tell about it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live
                            in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun?
                            Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes
                            sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. "Thank the Lord"? That
                            sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just
                            like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.
